This repository contains the core implementation of the <em>Speaker-aware CTC (SACTC) </em> algorithm for multi-talker overlapped speech recognition.

## SACTC - a Quick Preview

Speaker-aware CTC (SACTC) is a variant of CTC training objective, aims to control the CTC alighment with considering text tokens' speaker identity information.
It is built upon the [Bayesian Risk CTC](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bd7GueaTxUz) framework but specially designed for multi-talker overlapped speech recognition.


As illustrated in the below figure, tokens <span style="color:royalblue">1</span> and <span style="color:lightcoral">2,3,4</span> are from different speakers, while <span style="color:lightgreen">green area</span> indicates encouraged alignment paths. 
<em>SACTC requires the front-end encoder to disentangle separate speakers onto specific timeframes</em> ({ $u_1$} is at $t_1-t_2$; { $u_2$, $u_3$, $u_4$} are at $t_3-t_8$).

Visualizations of Conformer attention maps show the overlapped two speakers generally attend all frames in shallower blocks, while from layer 10 onwards, two speakers begin to focus on distinct temporal regions. 
In the figure below, red and blue represent attention from two speakers, and purple represents two speakers attending simultaneously.

## Requirments
- ESPnet and its required dependencies
- Additional packages used for scoring can be found in `./scoring/requirements.txt`

## Usage
To use this code, please:
1. Replace the original ESPnet code with code under the `./espnet2-patch` directory
2. Run ESPnet ASR recipe (refer to [Librispeech recipe](https://github.com/espnet/espnet/tree/master/egs2/librispeech/asr1)) using configurations under the `./config` directory
3. After ESPnet scoring, additionally perform permutation-invariant scoring with `./scoring/run_pi_scoring.sh`

`./run.sh` provides a running demo for more useful details. Please note that this code was developed under <b>ESPnet 202209 version</b> and might be incompatible with later versions.
